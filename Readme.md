## Virtual copilot for American Truck Simulator

This is a fork from ets2-telemetry-server by Funbit wich made easy to get data from our truck/travel by sharing memory and shows it as a web based dash board and an android app.
Check his repo for more info and install instructions

## Added functions
+ Save telemetry data to database (I would like to add a function to evaluate your history and calculate how good driver you are)
+ Reading serial port to get button actions and send key strokes to the simulator
+ start label (Runs ATS from steam)
